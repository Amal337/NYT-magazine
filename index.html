                <p class="par main__story-part1__paragraphs">CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant
                    young
                    physicist named Alan Guth, with a new son and a year’s appointment at Stanford, stayed up late with
                    his
                    notebook and equations, venturing far beyond the world of known physics.</p>
                <p class="par main__story-part1__paragraphs">He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some
                    exotic
                    particles that should have been created in the Big Bang. Instead he discovered what might have made
                    the
                    universe bang to begin with. A potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic evolution could have
                    infused space itself with a special energy that exerted a repulsive force, causing the universe to
                    swell
                    faster than the speed of light for a prodigiously violent instant.</p>
                <p class="par main__story-part1__paragraphs">If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like
                    why the
                    heavens look uniform from pole to pole and not like a jagged, warped mess. The enormous ballooning
                    would
                    iron out all the wrinkles and irregularities. Those particles were not missing, but would be diluted
                    beyond detection, like spit in the ocean.</p>
                <p class="par main__story-part1__paragraphs">“SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of
                    the page
                    and drew a double box around it.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="main__story-part2">
                <p class="par main__story-part2__paragraphs">On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers
                    reported
                    that they had seen the beginning of the Big Bang, and that his hypothesis, known undramatically as
                    inflation, looked right.</p>
                <p class="par main__story-part2__paragraphs">Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to the <a
                        href="#">first
                        sliver of cosmic time</a> with telescopes at the South Pole, a team of astronomers led by John
                    M. Kovac of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics detected ripples in the fabric of
                    space-time — so-called <a href="#">gravitational waves</a> — the signature of a universe being
                    wrenched violently apart when it was roughly a trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a
                    second old. They are the long-sought smoking-gun evidence of inflation, proof, Dr. Kovac and his
                    colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was correct.</p>
                <p class="par main__story-part2__paragraphs">Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years,
                    though
                    many, including Dr. Guth, wondered whether it could ever be proved.</p>
                <p class="par main__story-part2__paragraphs">If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark
                    in science
                    comparable to the recent discovery of dark energy pushing the universe apart, or of the Big Bang
                    itself. It would open vast realms of time and space and energy to science and speculation.</p>
                <p class="par main__story-part2__paragraphs">Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see,
                    extending 14
                    billion light-years in space with its hundreds of billions of galaxies, is only an infinitesimal
                    patch in a larger cosmos whose extent, architecture and fate are unknowable. Moreover, beyond our
                    own universe there might be an endless number of other universes bubbling into frothy eternity, like
                    a pot of pasta water boiling over.</p>

                <p class="par main__story-part3__paragraphs">In our own universe, it would serve as a window into the
                    forces operating at energies forever beyond the reach of particle accelerators on Earth and yield
                    new insights into gravity itself. Dr. Kovac’s ripples would be the first direct observation of
                    gravitational waves, which, according to Einstein’s theory of general relativity, should ruffle
                    space-time.</p>
                <p class="par main__story-part3__paragraphs">Marc Kamionkowski of Johns Hopkins University, an
                    early-universe expert who was not part of the team, said, “This is huge, as big as it gets.”</p>
                <p class="par main__story-part3__paragraphs">He continued, “This is a signal from the very earliest
                    universe, sending a telegram encoded in gravitational waves.”</p>
                <p class="par main__story-part3__paragraphs">The ripples manifested themselves as faint spiral patterns
                    in a bath of microwave radiation that permeates space and preserves a picture of the universe when
                    it was 380,000 years old and as hot as the surface of the sun.</p>
                <p class="par main__story-part3__paragraphs">Dr. Kovac and his collaborators, working in an experiment
                    known as Bicep, for Background Imaging of Cosmic Extragalactic Polarization, reported their results
                    in a scientific briefing at the Center for Astrophysics here on Monday and in a set of papers
                    submitted to The Astrophysical Journal.</p>

                    <p class="abs small">THE UNIVERSE is just under 14 billion years old. From our position in the Milky
                        Way galaxy, we can observe a sphere that is now about 92 billion light-years across. But there's
                        a mystery. Wherever we look, the universe has an even temperature.</p>
                    <p class="abs small">NOT ENOUGH TIME The universe is not old enough for light to have traveled the
                        vast distance from one side of the universe to the other, and there has not been enough time for
                        scattered patches of hot and cold to mix into an even temperature.</p>
                    <p class="abs small">DISTANT COFFEE At a smaller scale, imagine using a telescope to look a mile in
                        one direction. You see a coffee cup, and from the amount of steam, you can estimate its
                        temperature and how much it has cooled. </p>
                    <p class="abs small">COFFEE EVERYWHERE Now turn around and look a mile in the other direction. You
                        see a similar coffee cup, at exactly the same temperature. Coincidence? Maybe. But if you see a
                        similar cup in every direction, you might want to look for another explanation.</p>
                    <p class="abs small">STILL NOT ENOUGH TIME There has not been enough time to carry coffee cups from
                        place to place before they get cold. But if all the coffee cups were somehow filled from a
                        single coffee pot, all at the same time, that might explain their even temperature.</p>
                    <p class="abs small">INFLATION solves this problem. The theory proposes that, less than a trillionth
                        of a second after the Big Bang, the universe expanded faster than the speed of light. Tiny
                        ripples in the violently expanding energy field eventually grew into the large-scale structures
                        of the universe.</p>
                    <p class="abs small">FLUCTUATION Astronomers have now detected evidence of these ancient
                        fluctuations in swirls of polarized light in the cosmic background radiation, which is energy
                        left over from the early universe. These are gravitational waves predicted by Einstein.</p>
                    <p class="abs small">EXPANSION Returning to our coffee, imagine a single, central pot expanding
                        faster than light and cooling to an even temperature as it expands. That is something like
                        inflation. And the structure of the universe mirrors the froth and foam of the original pot.</p>

                <p class="par main__story-part3__paragraphs">Dr. Kovac said the chance that the results were a fluke was
                    only one in 10 million.</p>
                <p class="par main__story-part3__paragraphs">Dr. Guth, now 67, pronounced himself “bowled over,” saying
                    he had not expected such a definite confirmation in his lifetime.</p>
                <p class="par main__story-part3__paragraphs">“With nature, you have to be lucky,” he said. “Apparently
                    we have been lucky.”</p>
                <p class="par main__story-part3__paragraphs">The results are the closely guarded distillation of three
                    years’ worth of observations and analysis. Eschewing email for fear of a leak, Dr. Kovac personally
                    delivered drafts of his work to a select few, meeting with Dr. Guth, who is now a professor at
                    Massachusetts Institute of Technology (as is his son, Larry, who was sleeping that night in 1979),
                    in his office last week.</p>
                <p class="par main__story-part3__paragraphs">“It was a very special moment, and one we took very
                    seriously as scientists,” said Dr. Kovac, who chose his words as carefully as he tended his radio
                    telescopes.</p>
                <p class="par main__story-part3__paragraphs">Andrei Linde of Stanford, a prolific theorist who first
                    described the most popular variant of inflation, known as chaotic inflation, in 1983, was about to
                    go on vacation in the Caribbean last week when Chao-Lin Kuo, a Stanford colleague and a member of
                    Dr. Kovac’s team, <a href="#">knocked on his door with a bottle of Champagne</a> to tell him the
                    news.</p>

                <p class="par main__story-part3__paragraphs">Confused, Dr. Linde called out to his wife, asking if she
                    had ordered anything.</p>
                <p class="par main__story-part3__paragraphs">“And then I told him that in the beginning we thought that
                    this was a delivery but we did not think that we ordered anything, but I simply forgot that actually
                    I did order it, 30 years ago,” Dr. Linde wrote in an email.</p>
                <p class="par main__story-part3__paragraphs">Calling from Bonaire, the Dutch Caribbean island, Dr. Linde
                    said he was still hyperventilating. “Having news like this is the best way of spoiling a vacation,”
                    he said.</p>
                <p class="par main__story-part3__paragraphs">By last weekend, as social media was buzzing with rumors
                    that inflation had been seen and news spread, astrophysicists responded with a mixture of jubilation
                    and caution.</p>
                <p class="par main__story-part3__paragraphs">Max Tegmark, a cosmologist at M.I.T., wrote in an email, “I
                    think that if this stays true, it will go down as one of the greatest discoveries in the history of
                    science.”</p>
                <p class="par main__story-part3__paragraphs">John E. Carlstrom of the University of Chicago, Dr. Kovac’s
                    mentor and head of a competing project called the South Pole Telescope, pronounced himself deeply
                    impressed. “I think the results are beautiful and very convincing,” he said.</p>
                <p class="par main__story-part3__paragraphs">Paul J. Steinhardt of Princeton, author of a competitor to
                    inflation that posits the clash of a pair of universes as the cause of genesis, said that if true,
                    the Bicep result would eliminate his model, but he expressed reservations about inflation.</p>
                <p class="par main__story-part3__paragraphs">Lawrence M. Krauss of Arizona State and others also
                    emphasized the need for confirmation, noting that the new results exceeded earlier estimates based
                    on temperature maps of the cosmic background by the European Space Agency’s Planck satellite and
                    other assumptions about the universe.</p>
                <p class="par main__story-part3__paragraphs">“So we will need to wait and see before we jump up and
                    down,” Dr. Krauss said.</p>
                <p class="par main__story-part3__paragraphs">Corroboration might not be long in coming. The Planck
                    spacecraft will report its own findings this year. At least a dozen other teams are trying similar
                    measurements from balloons, mountaintops and space.</p>

                <p class="par main__story-part3__paragraphs">Gravity waves are the latest and deepest secret yet pried
                    out of the cosmic microwaves, which were discovered accidentally by Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson
                    at Bell Labs 50 years ago. They won the Nobel Prize.</p>
                <p class="par main__story-part3__paragraphs">Dr. Kovac has spent his career trying to read the secrets
                    of these waves. He is one of four leaders of Bicep, which has operated a series of increasingly
                    sensitive radio telescopes at the South Pole, where the thin, dry air creates ideal observing
                    conditions. The others are Clement Pryke of the University of Minnesota, Jamie Bock of the
                    California Institute of Technology and Dr. Kuo of Stanford.</p>

                    still be on the ground,” Dr. Kovac said. He has been there 23 times, he said, wintering over in
                    1994. “I’ve been hooked ever since,” he said.</p>
                <p class="par main__story-part4__paragraphs">In 2002, he was part of a team that discovered that the
                    microwave radiation was polarized, meaning the light waves had a slight preference to vibrate in one
                    direction rather than another.</p>
                <p class="par main__story-part4__paragraphs">This was a step toward the ultimate goal of detecting the
                    gravitational waves from inflation. Such waves, squeezing space in one direction and stretching it
                    in another as they go by, would twist the direction of polarization of the microwaves, theorists
                    said. As a result, maps of the polarization in the sky should have little arrows going in spirals.
                </p>
                <p class="par main__story-part4__paragraphs">Detecting those spirals required measuring infinitesimally
                    small differences in the temperature of the microwaves. The group’s telescope, Bicep2, is basically
                    a giant superconducting thermometer.</p>
                <p class="par main__story-part4__paragraphs">“We had no expectations what we would see,” Dr. Kovac said.
                </p>
                <p class="par main__story-part4__paragraphs">The strength of the signal surprised the researchers, and
                    they spent a year burning up time on a Harvard supercomputer, making sure they had things right and
                    worrying that competitors might beat them to the breakthrough.</p>

                <p class="par main__story-part4__paragraphs">The data traced the onset of inflation to a time that
                    physicists like Dr. Guth, staying up late in his Palo Alto house 35 years ago, suspected was a
                    special break point in the evolution of the universe.</p>
                <p class="par main__story-part4__paragraphs">Physicists recognize four forces at work in the world
                    today: gravity, electromagnetism, and strong and weak nuclear forces. But they have long suspected
                    that those are simply different manifestations of a single unified force that ruled the universe in
                    its earliest, hottest moments.</p>
                <p class="par main__story-part4__paragraphs">As the universe cooled, according to this theory, there was
                    a fall from grace, like some old folk mythology of gods or brothers falling out with each other. The
                    laws of physics evolved, with one force after another splitting away.</p>
                <p class="par main__story-part4__paragraphs">That was where Dr. Guth came in.</p>
                <p class="par main__story-part4__paragraphs">Under some circumstances, a glass of water can stay liquid
                    as the temperature falls below 32 degrees, until it is disturbed, at which point it will rapidly
                    freeze, releasing latent heat.</p>
                <p class="par main__story-part4__paragraphs">Similarly, the universe could “supercool” and stay in a
                    unified state too long. In that case, space itself would become imbued with a mysterious latent
                    energy.</p>
                <p class="par main__story-part4__paragraphs">Inserted into Einstein’s equations, the latent energy would
                    act as a kind of antigravity, and the universe would blow itself up. Since it was space itself
                    supplying the repulsive force, the more space was created, the harder it pushed apart.</p>
                <p class="par main__story-part4__paragraphs">What would become our observable universe mushroomed in
                    size at least a trillion trillionfold — from a submicroscopic speck of primordial energy to the size
                    of a grapefruit — in less than a cosmic eye-blink.</p>
                <p class="par main__story-part4__paragraphs">Almost as quickly, this pulse would subside, relaxing into
                    ordinary particles and radiation. All of normal cosmic history was still ahead, resulting in today’s
                    observable universe, a patch of sky and stars billions of light-years across. “It’s often said that
                    there is no such thing as a free lunch,” Dr. Guth likes to say, “but the universe might be the
                    ultimate free lunch.”</p>
                <p class="par main__story-part4__paragraphs">Make that free lunches. Most of the hundred or so models
                    resulting from Dr. Guth’s original vision suggest that inflation, once started, is eternal. Even as
                    our own universe settled down to a comfortable homey expansion, the rest of the cosmos will continue
                    blowing up, spinning off other bubbles endlessly, a concept known as the multiverse.</p>
                <p class="par main__story-part4__paragraphs">So the future of the cosmos is perhaps bright and fecund,
                    but do not bother asking about going any deeper into the past.</p>
                <p class="par main__story-part4__paragraphs">We might never know what happened before inflation, at the
                    very beginning, because inflation erases everything that came before it. All the chaos and
                    randomness of the primordial moment are swept away, forever out of our view.</p>
                <p class="par main__story-part4__paragraphs">“If you trace your cosmic roots,” said Abraham Loeb, a
                    Harvard-Smithsonian astronomer who was not part of the team, “you wind up at inflation.”</p>
